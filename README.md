# HockeyBot

A Discord bot made using the API to simulate hockey games with server members as players, originally created for use within a friends Discord server!!

## Adding to Server

Currently the bot is not available for all, but when it is, admins will be able to customize game start times and players and so on

## Changelog

**Scheduled Games:**

Games are now played automatically at 7pm EST every day within the servers bot channel with randomized teams

**Hosting:**

The bot is now hosted using the Heroku's cloud services! Originally I was hoping to host on a Raspberry Pi but they're not available due to computer chip shortages but I always wanted to experiment with the cloud so it's not the worst outcome
