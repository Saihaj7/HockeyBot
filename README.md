# HockeyBot

A Discord bot made using the API to simulate hockey games with server members as players, originally created for use within a friends Discord server!!

## Installation

Not yet available for everybody!!! 

## Future Developments

Lots of features planned for the future, many of them written in my comments in the code. For now I'm prioritized on getting it to a point where it can play games on it's own so I can host it in the cloud so my friends can use it
